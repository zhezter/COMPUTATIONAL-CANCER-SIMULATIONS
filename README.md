# COMPUTATIONAL-CANCER-SIMULATIONS

Main content of the simulations developed for the Differential Calculus project based on the research article *Modelos matemáticos para el crecimiento de células tumorales*.

This project is Open Source and can be used for basic computational simulations. However, attribution of this project is exclusively reserved for the owners of this repository.

## Project Dependencies

The simulations were designed using Python libraries. To ensure proper execution of the computational simulations presented here, you need to install the required libraries.

You can install the basic dependencies with:

*In the future*
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
